# The Terraform Challenge

The following terraform is mostly functional.  You are free to make changes to the code in any way you see fit.  
The only requirement is that a web page is hosted on an ec2 instance and the traffic flows through a load balancer.
The default index page from the load balancer should display "IT WORKS".

Side quests can include:
- improved security
- high(er) availability
- containerization
- fun with DNS
